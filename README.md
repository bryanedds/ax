# Ax - The Axiomatic Core C++ Library. [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/bryanedds/ax/blob/master/LICENSE.md) 

## Features

- A light-weight reflection system in **"reflection.hpp"**
- A serialization system in **"serialization.hpp"**
- A publisher-neutral C++ event system in **"events.hpp"**
- A dynamic property system in **"properties.hpp"**
- A meta-linguistic programming system in **"symbolics.hpp"**
- Optimized dynamic type casting system in **"casting.hpp"**
- Functional operations map, filter, and fold (with more coming soon!) in **"functional.hpp"**
- Algebraic data types including option, either, choice, pair and record, w/ macros for automatic derivation, 
and a type-safe pattern matching system in **"algebraic.hpp"**
- An entity-component-system prototype in **"system.hpp"**
- A couple other odds and ends in **"utility.hpp"**

This library makes a good base for non-trivial projects like renderers, game engines, and other projects that absolutely *need* to be built with good programming semantics.

## WIP
Note this project has not reached alpha-status, so not recommended for use in production without serious care. Tests and fixes are coming along over time, however :)
