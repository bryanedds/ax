Ax - The Axiomatic Core C++ Library.
===

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bryanedds/ax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bryanedds/ax)

Features
---

- A light-weight reflection system in **"reflection.hpp"**
- A serialization system in **"serialization.hpp"**
- A publisher-neutral C++ event system in **"events.hpp"**
- A dynamic property system in **"properties.hpp"**
- A generalized meta-language system in **"metalang.hpp"**
- Optimized dynamic type casting system in **"casting.hpp"**
- Functional operations map, filter, and fold (with more coming soon!) in **"functional.hpp"**
- Algebraic data types including option, either, choice, pair and record, w/ macros for automatic derivation, 
and a type-safe pattern matching system in **"algebraic.hpp"**
- A couple other odds and ends in **"utility.hpp"**

Ax was built in the clean and modular Data Abstration Style - https://github.com/bryanedds/das

This library makes a good base for non-trivial projects like renderers, game engines, and other real-ass shit that absolutely *needs* to be built with good programming semantics.

WIP

Note this project has not reached alpha-status, so not recommended for use in production without serious care. Tests are coming along over time, however :)
